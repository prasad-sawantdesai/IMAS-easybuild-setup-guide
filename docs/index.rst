IMAS EasyBuild setup guide
==========================

This guide provides three approaches to set up EasyBuild and Lmod on RHEL-based systems:

1. **Userspace Setup** - No root access required! Install entirely in your home directory (recommended for users without admin access)
2. **Automated System-wide Setup** - Use provided scripts for quick system-wide installation (recommended for administrators)
3. **Manual Setup** - Step-by-step instructions for learning and custom configurations

Choose the approach that best fits your needs.
